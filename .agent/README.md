**Documentation Guidelines**: Try to keep total documentation below 2,300 lines. Focus on clarity and conciseness over exhaustive detail.

## üìù Documentation Conventions

### When to Update Docs

- **After implementing a feature** ‚Üí Update `system/` docs to reflect new state
- **Before starting a feature** ‚Üí Check if task exists in `Tasks/`, if not, create one
- **When establishing a pattern** ‚Üí Document it in `SOP/`
- **When changing architecture** ‚Üí Update `project_architecture.md`. Changes in architecture require explicit user permission
- **When modifying database** ‚Üí Update `database_schema.md`
- **When adding/changing LLM tools** ‚Üí Update `llm_integration.md`
- **When adding complex features** ‚Üí Consider dedicated system doc (e.g., `group_nodes_system.md`)

### Doc Update Workflow

1. Implement your feature
2. Update relevant `system/` documentation
3. Update this README if you added new doc files
4. Commit docs with your code changes

### Keep Docs Evergreen

- Docs describe **current state**, not history
- Remove outdated information
- Update examples to match current code
- No "old way" vs "new way" comparisons

## üéØ For New Engineers

**Getting Started:**
1. Read [project_architecture.md](./system/project_architecture.md) - Get the big picture
2. Read [database_schema.md](./system/database_schema.md) - Understand persistence layer
3. Read [llm_integration.md](./system/llm_integration.md) - Learn how AI works
4. Read [group_nodes_system.md](./system/group_nodes_system.md) - Understand group feature
5. Explore `../tests/` directory - See how features are tested

**For Development:**
1. Check `Tasks/` for existing feature docs
2. Review relevant `system/` docs
3. Follow `SOP/` guides for standard tasks (especially [unified-flow-commands.md](./SOP/unified-flow-commands.md))
4. Keep docs updated as you work

- Test coverage: 86.38% overall (v8 provider)
- Database: 4 tables (removed visual_settings)
- Design system: Organized token categories (colors, typography, spacing 4px base, borders, shadows, animations, z-index, opacity)
