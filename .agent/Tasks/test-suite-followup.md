Test Suite Follow-up
====================

What I Noticed
--------------
- From a quick read-through, the existing Jest coverage leans heavily on server-side tools, DB persistence, group utilities, and visual settings helpers.
- I didnâ€™t spot automated checks around the React layer (e.g., `App`, `Node`, `useFlowLayout`) or the conversation retry loop in `POST /api/conversation/message`.
- `tests/visual-settings-llm.test.js` seems to document expected tool wiring but never actually calls the parsing logic.

Follow-up Questions
-------------------
1. **Front-end Interaction Coverage**  
   Should we add component or integration tests for `src/App.jsx`, `src/Node.jsx`, and `src/hooks/useFlowLayout.js` so UI behaviors receive the same scrutiny as the backend helpers?
2. **Conversation API Regression Tests**  
   Do we want supertest coverage for `POST /api/conversation/message`, possibly with mocked LLM responses, to verify the retry logic and response formats?
3. **LLM Tool Definition Enforcement**  
   Would it help to have `tests/visual-settings-llm.test.js` exercise `parseToolCalls` (or the tool builders) to catch schema drift instead of just asserting static expectations?
4. **Group Visualization Edge Cases**  
   Is it worth adding tests around `GroupHaloOverlay` and `addChildNode` in `src/utils/groupUtils.js` to cover halo rendering and synthetic edge generation scenarios?

Folder Structure Thoughts
-------------------------
- The `tests/` directory currently mixes unit, integration, and end-to-end suites at one level (with a small `tests/integration/` subfolder). If we grow coverage, should we split into `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, and `tests/e2e` (or similar) and relocate existing files accordingly?

Notes
-----
- Most of the current suites rely on the in-memory SQLite setup; any new tests can likely reuse the same pattern to keep runs fast.
- Depending on how many new tests we add, we might consider splitting `tests/` into clearer unit vs. integration folders later.
