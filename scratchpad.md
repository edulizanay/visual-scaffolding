## 2025-10-06 - Undo/Redo Bug Fix

✅ Fixed undo/redo auto-save bug in historyService.js
- Moved truncation (lines 108-111) to AFTER duplicate checks
- Auto-save after undo now checks for duplicates first, preserving redo chain
- Tests passing: both duplicate and position-only change scenarios work

## 2025-10-06 - Smooth Dagre Layout Animations

### Phase 1: CSS Animation Attempt (Completed)
✅ Created branch: feat/smooth-dagre-animations
✅ Added CSS transitions to nodes (animations.css)
✅ Refactored layout application with applyLayoutWithAnimation helper
✅ Simplified nested state logic in manual/LLM node creation flows

**Issue discovered:** CSS transitions on nodes work, but edges don't follow smoothly
- Nodes animate with CSS (outside React render cycle)
- Edges only update on React re-renders
- Creates visual disconnect/"eerie effect" - edges snap while nodes glide

### Phase 2: JavaScript Animation Implementation (In Progress)
📍 Switching to d3-timer for frame-by-frame animation
- Nodes will update via React state ~60fps
- Edges automatically recalculate each frame (perfect sync)
- Added isAnimating flag to prevent auto-save spam during animation
- d3-timer already installed (was in dependencies)

**Current status:** Implementing JavaScript animation in App.jsx
**Next:** Remove CSS transition, add d3-timer animation logic

### Implementation Complete ✅
✅ Removed CSS transition from animations.css
✅ Added d3-timer import to App.jsx
✅ Added isAnimating state and animationTimerRef
✅ Updated auto-save effect to skip during animation
✅ Replaced applyLayoutWithAnimation with d3-timer animation
✅ Added cleanup effect for animation timer on unmount

**How it works:**
- d3-timer updates node positions ~60fps over 800ms
- Edges recalculate on every frame (perfect sync with nodes)
- isAnimating flag prevents auto-save spam during animation
- Cubic ease-out easing (matches previous CSS timing)
- Safety timeout ensures flag resets after 1000ms

**Ready for testing:** Manual node creation and LLM flows

### Testing Results ✅
✅ Manual node creation (Cmd+double-click) - edges follow smoothly
✅ LLM node creation - edges follow smoothly
✅ No visual disconnect - perfect synchronization
✅ Auto-save behavior correct

### Tech Debt Cleanup ✅
Fixed three issues identified during code review:
1. ✅ Added missing `setIsAnimating` dependency to useCallback
2. ✅ Removed duplicate safety setTimeout (simplified completion logic)
3. ✅ Deleted unused animations.css file and import

**Final status:** Feature complete, no tech debt remaining
